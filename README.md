# TrackVibe -- Wellness & Fitness Tracking Application

**TrackVibe** is a full-stack, mobile-first wellness application for tracking **body** (workouts, exercises), **energy** (food, calories, macros, sleep), and **goals**. It features a **voice agent** powered by Google Gemini that understands natural language, an **intelligent food lookup pipeline** that combines a curated database with LLM-generated nutrition data, **vector embeddings** for semantic search, and **Redis-backed caching** for performance.

Built with **React + TypeScript + Vite** (frontend), **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** (backend), **PostgreSQL + pgvector** (database), and optional **Redis** (caching, queues, event bus).

### Component Descriptions

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Frontend** | React SPA with TanStack Query for server state, React Router for navigation, Tailwind + shadcn/ui for styling. Stores JWT in localStorage. |
| **Backend / Gateway** | Express API handling auth, domain CRUD (workouts, food entries, check-ins, goals), food search, voice understanding, file uploads. When `*_SERVICE_URL` env vars are set, proxies those paths to extracted services. |
| **PostgreSQL + pgvector** | Primary data store. Stores users, workouts, food entries, goals, and the `foods` reference table (~2000+ items). The `pgvector` extension enables 768-dimensional vector similarity search via HNSW indexes. |
| **Redis** | Optional but recommended. Provides: distributed rate limiting, food search caching (1h TTL), BullMQ voice job queue, key-value store for job results, and event bus transport. |
| **Voice Worker** | Processes audio jobs from BullMQ. Calls Gemini API, writes results to Redis for client polling. |
| **Google Gemini** | LLM used for two purposes: (1) voice intent parsing via function calling, (2) nutrition data lookup for foods not in the database. |
| **Embedding Model** | Google's `text-embedding-004` generates 768-dim vectors for semantic search across food entries and workouts. |
| **AWS S3** | Stores user-uploaded images and videos (food photos, exercise demos, avatars, workout photos) via pre-signed URLs. |
| **Event Bus** | Publishes domain events after every write operation. Transport: Redis BullMQ (default) or AWS SQS. Optional event-consumer process runs handlers. |

### Deployment Modes

| Mode | Description | Redis Required |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **A -- Single process** (default) | One `node index.js` process handles everything. Events are in-memory if Redis is not set. | No |
| **B -- API + event consumer** | Two processes: API (publishes events) and `node workers/event-consumer.js` (consumes events). | Yes |
| **C -- Gateway + extracted services** | Set `*_SERVICE_URL` env vars. Main app acts as gateway, proxying requests to separate Body/Energy/Goals services. | Yes |

## LLM / Gemini Integration

TrackVibe uses Google Gemini in two distinct roles:

### 1. Voice Intent Parsing

When a user speaks or types natural language (e.g., "I had two eggs and a coffee for breakfast"), the backend sends the text to Gemini along with **23 function declarations** (tools). Gemini returns structured function calls that the backend executes.

**Flow:**
```
User input: "I had two eggs and a coffee"
     |
     v
POST /api/voice/understand { text: "I had two eggs and a coffee" }
     |
     v
Gemini receives: system prompt + user text + 23 function declarations
     |
     v
Gemini returns: [
  { name: "add_food", args: { food: "egg", amount: 2, unit: "eggs" } },
  { name: "add_food", args: { food: "coffee", amount: 1, unit: "cup" } }
]
     |
     v
Backend executes each action:
  - lookupNutrition("egg", 2, "eggs") → { calories: 143, protein: 12.6, ... }
  - lookupNutrition("coffee", 1, "cup") → { calories: 2, protein: 0.3, ... }
  - INSERT into food_entries for each
     |
     v
Response: { actions: [...], results: [...] }
```

**Function declarations** include: `add_food`, `edit_food_entry`, `delete_food_entry`, `add_workout`, `edit_workout`, `delete_workout`, `log_sleep`, `add_goal`, `edit_goal`, `delete_goal`, `log_weight`, `log_water`, `log_cycle`, `update_profile`, and trainer variants for managing other users' data.

**Safety settings:** All harm categories are set to `BLOCK_NONE` to prevent the model from refusing food-related queries that might be misclassified (e.g., "I ate a bloody steak" could trigger harm filters).

**Fallback behavior:** If Gemini blocks the response or returns an error, the backend returns an `add_food` action with the raw transcript as the food name and zero nutrition values. This ensures the user is never stuck -- they can always log food and edit the details later.

### 2. Food Nutrition Lookup

When a food is not found in the local database, Gemini is used as a nutrition data assistant. See [Food Lookup Pipeline](#food-lookup-pipeline) for the full flow.

---

## Food Lookup Pipeline

The food lookup pipeline resolves a food name (e.g., "coke zero") to complete nutrition data. It uses a **2-tier strategy** with a graceful fallback.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Input["User says: 'coke zero, 330ml'"]
  Tier1["Tier 1: Local Database Search"]
  Found1{"Found?"}
  Tier2["Tier 2: Gemini AI Lookup"]
  Found2{"Valid response?"}
  Fallback["Tier 3: Fallback (zero nutrition)"]
  Scale["Scale to user's portion"]
  Result["Return: name, calories, protein, carbs, fat"]

  Input --> Tier1
  Tier1 --> Found1
  Found1 -->|Yes| Scale
  Found1 -->|No| Tier2
  Tier2 --> Found2
  Found2 -->|Yes| Scale
  Found2 -->|No| Fallback
  Fallback --> Result
  Scale --> Result
```

### Tier 1: Local Database

The `getNutritionForFoodName()` function searches the `foods` table using multiple matching strategies:

1. **Word-boundary regex** on `common_name` and `name` -- "chicken breast" finds "Chicken breast, grilled" even when words aren't adjacent
2. **Trigram similarity** (pg_trgm) > 0.6 -- handles typos like "chiken" matching "chicken"
3. Results are ranked by: exact match > prefix match > similarity score > cooking method preference > name length (shorter = more specific)

If found, nutrition is **scaled to the user's portion**: `(user_grams / 100) * per_100g_value`.

### Tier 2: Gemini AI

When the food is not in the database and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured, the `lookupAndCreateFood()` function:

1. **Sends a structured prompt** to Gemini asking for nutrition data in a specific JSON format
2. **Validates the response** with a Zod schema that enforces ranges:
   - `calories`: 0-1000 kcal per 100g/100ml
   - `protein`, `carbs`, `fat`: 0-100g each
   - `is_liquid`: boolean (determines per-100g vs per-100ml)
   - `serving_sizes_ml`: { can, bottle, glass } for liquids
   - `default_unit`: for countable foods (egg, slice, can)
   - `unit_weight_grams`: weight per unit (50g for an egg)
   - `search_aliases`: informal names (["coke zero", "zero"] for "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar")
3. **Checks for duplicates** -- case-insensitive name match or search_aliases match
4. **INSERTs into the `foods` table** with all metadata, making it available for future lookups instantly
5. **Scales** the per-100g values to the user's requested portion and returns the result

### Tier 3: Fallback

If both tiers fail, returns the food name with zero nutrition and `source: 'fallback'`. The user can manually edit the entry. This guarantees the user is never blocked from logging food.

### Example: "zero" to "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, 330ml"

```
Input: food="zero", amount=330, unit="ml"

Tier 1: Database search for "zero"
  - search_aliases check: "zero" matches ["coke zero", "zero"] on "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar"
  - Returns: { calories: 0.3, protein: 0, carbs: 0, fat: 0, is_liquid: true, per 100ml }
  - Scale: (330 / 100) * values

Output: { name: "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar", calories: 1, protein: 0, carbs: 0, fat: 0, source: "db" }
```

If "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar" were NOT in the database:
```
Tier 2: Gemini prompt → "Food or drink name: zero"
  - Gemini returns: { name: "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar", calories: 0.3, ..., is_liquid: true,
                       serving_sizes_ml: { can: 330, bottle: 500, glass: 250 },
                       search_aliases: ["coke zero", "zero", "coca cola zero"] }
  - Zod validates → passes
  - Duplicate check → not found
  - INSERT into foods table (now cached for all future lookups)
  - Scale to 330ml

Output: { name: "Coca-Cola Zero Sugar", calories: 1, ..., source: "gemini" }
```

---

## Food Search & Vector Embeddings

### Text-Based Food Search

The public `GET /api/food/search?q=<query>` endpoint uses a sophisticated multi-tier search algorithm in `src/models/foodSearch.ts`:

**Matching strategies** (used simultaneously, results ranked by relevance):

| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Word-split LIKE** | All query words must appear in `common_name` or `name` | "chicken breast" matches "Chicken breast, grilled" |
| **Trigram similarity** (pg_trgm) | Fuzzy matching for typos, threshold > 0.15 | "chiken brest" matches "Chicken breast" |
| **Full-text search** (tsvector) | Stemmed word matching via `name_tsv` column | "running" matches "Runner beans" |
| **Search aliases** | Exact match against `search_aliases` text array | "zero" matches Coca-Cola Zero Sugar |

**Relevance ranking** (ORDER BY):
1. Exact name match (highest priority)
2. Search alias exact match
3. Prefix match (name starts with query)
4. Full-text search match
5. Trigram similarity score (higher = better)
6. Cooking method preference ("cooked" preferred over "uncooked")
7. Name length (shorter = more specific)

**Fallback tiers:** If pg_trgm or common_name columns are unavailable (older schema), the search gracefully degrades through 3 fallback tiers, each using fewer features but still returning results.

### Vector Embeddings (Semantic Search)

TrackVibe also supports **semantic search** using vector embeddings for personalized content discovery:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Model** | Google `text-embedding-004` |
| **Dimensions** | 768 |
| **Storage** | PostgreSQL `vector(768)` column via pgvector extension |
| **Index** | HNSW with cosine distance (`vector_cosine_ops`) |
| **Table** | `user_embeddings` with `record_type` (food_entry / workout) |

**How it works:**
1. When a food entry or workout is created, its descriptive text is embedded into a 768-dimensional vector
2. The vector is stored in `user_embeddings` alongside the `record_id` and `record_type`
3. To search, the query text is embedded and compared against stored vectors using cosine similarity
4. Results are ranked by similarity score, enabling fuzzy semantic matching

**Use case:** A user searching for "protein shake" could find their previous entries for "whey protein with milk" or "chocolate protein smoothie" even though the exact words don't match.

---

## Redis Architecture

Redis is **optional** but significantly enhances the application. When `REDIS_URL` is not set, the app uses in-memory alternatives for each feature.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Redis Roles
    Cache["Food Search Cache\n1h TTL"]
    Queue["BullMQ Voice Queue\nAsync audio processing"]
    RateLimit["Rate Limiting Store\nDistributed counters"]
    KV["Key-Value Store\nJob results, idempotency"]
    Events["Event Bus Transport\nDomain events"]
  end
```

### Food Search Cache

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Key pattern** | `food:search:{query}:{limit}` |
| **TTL** | 3600 seconds (1 hour) |
| **Content** | Serialized array of food search results |
| **Invalidation** | TTL-based expiry only |
| **Fallback** | No cache; every request hits PostgreSQL |

When a user searches for "chicken", the first request queries PostgreSQL and stores the result in Redis. Subsequent searches for "chicken" within the hour return instantly from cache.

### BullMQ Voice Queue

Audio voice requests are too slow for synchronous HTTP. The flow:
1. Client POSTs audio (base64) to `/api/voice/understand`
2. Backend creates a BullMQ job with the audio data
3. Returns `{ jobId, pollUrl }` to the client
4. Client polls `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` until status is `completed`
5. Voice worker picks up the job, calls Gemini, writes result to Redis
6. Next poll returns the parsed actions

### Key-Value Store

A generic TTL-enabled key-value store (`src/lib/keyValueStore.ts`):
- Uses Redis when available
- Falls back to an **in-memory Map** with LRU eviction (max 10,000 entries)
- Cleanup interval: 5 minutes
- Used for: job results, idempotency keys, temporary data

### Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| All `/api` routes | 200 requests | 15 minutes per IP |
| Auth routes (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`) | 10 requests | 15 minutes per IP |

With Redis: distributed `rate-limit-redis` store shared across instances. Without Redis: in-memory store (per-process).

### Event Bus

Domain events (e.g., `energy.FoodEntryCreated`, `body.WorkoutCreated`) are published after every write operation. Transport options:
- **Redis** (default): BullMQ queue named `events`
- **SQS**: AWS SQS queue (set `EVENT_TRANSPORT=sqs` and `EVENT_QUEUE_URL`)

---

---

## Image & Video Handling

TrackVibe uses **AWS S3 with pre-signed URLs** for file uploads. The client never sends file data through the backend -- it uploads directly to S3.

### Upload Flow

```
1. Client: POST /api/uploads/presigned-url { mimeType: "image/jpeg", context: "food" }
2. Backend: Generates pre-signed PUT URL (5-minute expiry)
3. Backend: Returns { uploadUrl, fileUrl }
4. Client: PUT file directly to S3 using uploadUrl
5. Client: Stores fileUrl on the resource (food entry, workout, etc.)
```

### Valid Contexts and MIME Types

| Context | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `avatar` | User profile picture |
| `workout` | Workout photo |
| `food` | Food photo |
| `exercise-video` | Exercise demonstration video |

| Category | Allowed MIME Types |
|----------|-------------------|
| Images | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif` |
| Videos | `video/mp4`, `video/quicktime`, `video/webm` |

### S3 File Structure
```
s3://<bucket>/users/<userId>/<context>/<randomId>.<ext>
```

### Food Images
- The `foods` table has an `image_url` column
- USDA foods are seeded with images via migration `1773600000001_seed-food-images.js`
- Gemini-created foods can have images added later
- Food search results include `imageUrl` in the response

---

## Voice Flow

| Mode | Input | Flow | Redis Required |
|------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Text** (sync) | `{ transcript }` | `POST /api/voice/understand` -> Gemini -> `{ actions }` | No |
| **Audio** (async) | `{ audio, mimeType }` | `POST` -> BullMQ job -> `{ jobId, pollUrl }` -> client polls `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` -> worker processes via Gemini -> result stored in Redis | Yes |

### Voice Tools (23 Function Declarations)

The voice system provides Gemini with 23 function declarations covering all CRUD operations:

**Food:** `add_food`, `edit_food_entry`, `delete_food_entry`
**Workouts:** `add_workout`, `edit_workout`, `delete_workout`
**Sleep:** `log_sleep`, `edit_check_in`, `delete_check_in`
**Goals:** `add_goal`, `edit_goal`, `delete_goal`
**Health:** `log_weight`, `log_water`, `log_cycle`, `update_profile`
**Trainer:** `trainer_add_food`, `trainer_add_workout` (manage other users)

### Agent Tools (Extended)

The agent mode adds **7 read/copy tools** on top of voice tools:

- `get_workouts` -- Fetch workouts by date
- `get_food_entries` -- Fetch food entries by date
- `get_goals` -- Fetch all goals
- `get_weight_entries` -- Fetch weight history
- `get_water_today` -- Get today's water intake
- `copy_food_entries` -- Copy all food entries from one date to multiple dates
- `copy_workout` -- Copy a workout to another date

---

## Meal Copying & Repetition

The `copy_food_entries` agent tool enables meal repetition via voice:

**Capability:** Copy all food entries from a source date to one or more target dates.

**Example voice commands:**
- "Copy today's meals to tomorrow"
- "Repeat this meal plan for the whole week"
- "Copy Monday's food to Wednesday and Thursday"

**How it works:**
1. User speaks: "repeat today's meals for the next 3 days"
2. Gemini calls `copy_food_entries` with `{ fromDate: "2026-03-13", toDates: ["2026-03-14", "2026-03-15", "2026-03-16"] }`
3. Backend fetches all food entries for `fromDate`
4. Creates identical entries for each target date
5. Returns confirmation with the number of entries copied

---

## Future: Meal Plan Feature

The following meal plan capabilities are envisioned for future development:

### Planned Features
- **CSV Import**: Upload a CSV file with a weekly meal plan (day, meal, food, portion, calories) to bulk-create food entries
- **Manual Meal Plans**: Create a named meal plan (e.g., "Cutting Diet", "Bulking Plan") with a list of foods per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
- **Recurring Schedules**: "Repeat this plan every day for 2 weeks" or "Apply this meal plan Monday through Friday"
- **Meal Templates**: Save a day's food entries as a template that can be applied to future dates with one tap

### Current Alternative
Today, users can achieve basic meal repetition using the `copy_food_entries` voice command to duplicate a day's food entries to future dates.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL with `pgvector` and `pg_trgm` extensions
- (Optional) Redis for caching, async voice, event bus

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repo-url>
cd TrackVibe

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, optionally GEMINI_API_KEY and REDIS_URL
npm run migrate:up        # Run database migrations
npm run seed:popular-foods # Seed ~100 common foods (or npm run import:foods for full USDA dataset)
npm run dev               # Start with auto-reload

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
# Create .env: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
npm run dev               # Starts on http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Docker

**Docker Compose** (backend + frontend + Redis):

```bash
# Create backend/.env with DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET
docker compose up --build
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:3000
```

**Individual services:**

```bash
# Backend
docker build -t trackvibe-backend ./backend
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file backend/.env trackvibe-backend

# Frontend
docker build -t trackvibe-frontend --build-arg VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 ./frontend
docker run -p 5173:3000 trackvibe-frontend
```

---

## Deployment

### Railway
- **Backend**: Set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}`
- **Frontend**: Build with `VITE_API_URL` pointing to the backend URL
- Health: `GET /health` (200), `GET /ready` (200 if DB and Redis reachable)

### AWS
- EC2 or ECS for the main API
- Lambda for event and voice handlers (SAM template in `backend/template.yaml`)
- SQS for event bus and voice queue
- See `docs/architecture-target-aws.md` and `docs/scale-harden-aws.md`

## Railway Architecture Deep Dive

On Railway, TrackVibe runs as a **single backend process** that contains both the Express API and the BullMQ Voice Worker in the same Node.js process. Redis connects the synchronous API layer to asynchronous background processing.

### Railway Service Topology

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph user [User]
    Browser[Browser / Mobile]
  end

  subgraph railway [Railway]
    subgraph fe [Frontend Service]
      SPA[React SPA<br/>server.cjs]
    end

    subgraph be [Backend Service - Single Process]
      API[Express API<br/>Routes + Controllers]
      VoiceWorker[Voice Worker<br/>BullMQ concurrency:5]
      EventsWorker[Events Worker<br/>BullMQ concurrency:5]
    end

    Redis[(Railway Redis)]
  end

  subgraph supabase [Supabase]
    Postgres[(PostgreSQL<br/>+ pgvector + pg_trgm)]
  end

  subgraph external [External APIs]

    S3[AWS S3<br/>Images/Videos]
  end

  VoiceWorker --> Gemini
  VoiceWorker --> Postgres
  VoiceWorker -->|"store result"| Redis
  API -->|"publish event"| Redis
  Redis -->|"consume"| EventsWorker
  EventsWorker --> Postgres
  API --> S3
```

### Voice Action Flow: Text Mode (Synchronous)

When the user types or uses browser speech-to-text, the entire flow is **synchronous** within a single HTTP request:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant F as Frontend
  participant A as Backend API
  participant G as Gemini API
  participant DB as PostgreSQL
  participant R as Redis
  participant EW as Events Worker

  U->>F: Speaks "two eggs and a coffee"
  Note over F: Browser Web Speech API<br/>transcribes to text
  F->>A: POST /api/voice/understand<br/>{ transcript: "two eggs and a coffee" }
  A->>G: Send transcript + 23 function declarations
  G-->>A: Function calls:<br/>add_food("egg", 2, "eggs")<br/>add_food("coffee", 1, "cup")

  Note over A: Food Lookup Pipeline (per food)

  A->>DB: Tier 1: Search foods table<br/>"egg" → word-boundary match
  DB-->>A: Found: Egg, per 100g<br/>cal:148, p:10, c:1.6, f:11

  A->>DB: Tier 1: Search foods table<br/>"coffee" → word-boundary match
  DB-->>A: Found: Coffee, per 100ml<br/>cal:2, p:0.3, c:0, f:0

  Note over A: Scale to portions:<br/>2 eggs = 100g → cal:148<br/>1 cup coffee = 240ml → cal:5

  A->>DB: INSERT food_entries (×2)

  Note over A: Publish domain events (async)
  A->>R: Enqueue: energy.FoodEntryCreated (×2)
  A-->>F: { actions: [...], results: [...] }
  F-->>U: Shows logged food with calories

  Note over R,EW: Meanwhile, asynchronously...
  R->>EW: Dequeue events
  EW->>DB: Update user_daily_stats (total calories)
  EW->>DB: Log to user_activity_log
  EW->>DB: Update streak counts
  Note over EW: Send push notification<br/>(if subscribed)
```

### Voice Action Flow: Audio Mode (Fully Async)

When the user sends raw audio (e.g., from mobile), the flow is **fully asynchronous** with Redis as the job queue:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant F as Frontend
  participant A as Backend API
  participant R as Redis
  participant VW as Voice Worker
  participant G as Gemini API
  participant DB as PostgreSQL

  U->>F: Records audio
  F->>A: POST /api/voice/understand<br/>{ audio: "<base64>", mimeType: "audio/webm" }
  A->>R: Create BullMQ job in "voice" queue<br/>Store: job:{jobId} = {status:"pending"}
  A-->>F: { jobId: "abc123", pollUrl: "/api/jobs/abc123" }

  Note over F: Client starts polling every ~1s

  F->>A: GET /api/jobs/abc123
  A->>R: GET job:abc123
  R-->>A: { status: "pending" }
  A-->>F: { status: "pending" }

  Note over VW: Voice Worker picks up job<br/>(concurrency: 5)

  R->>VW: Dequeue voice job
  VW->>G: Send raw audio + 23 function declarations
  G-->>VW: Function calls:<br/>add_food("egg", 2, "eggs")<br/>add_food("coffee", 1, "cup")
  VW->>DB: Lookup nutrition + INSERT food_entries
  VW->>R: SET job:abc123 = {status:"completed", result:{...}}<br/>TTL: 300s (5 min)

  F->>A: GET /api/jobs/abc123
  A->>R: GET job:abc123
  R-->>A: { status: "completed", result: {actions:[...]} }
  A-->>F: { status: "completed", actions: [...] }
  F-->>U: Shows logged food with calories
```

### Event-Driven Pipeline

Every write operation (food entry, workout, goal, check-in) publishes a domain event. On Railway, these are processed by the Events Worker running in the same process:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph "API Write Operations"
    FE[Food Entry Created]
    WO[Workout Created]
    GO[Goal Updated]
    CI[Check-In Created]
  end

  subgraph "Redis BullMQ"
    EQ["events" queue<br/>3 retries, exponential backoff]
    DLQ["events-dlq"<br/>Dead Letter Queue]
  end

  subgraph "Event Consumers (async)"
    SA[statsAggregator<br/>Updates user_daily_stats<br/>total calories + workout count]
    UAL[userActivityLog<br/>Logs action to<br/>user_activity_log table]
    PN[pushNotifier<br/>Sends browser push<br/>notification]
    SU[streakUpdater<br/>Updates workout<br/>streak counts]
  end

  FE --> EQ
  WO --> EQ
  GO --> EQ
  CI --> EQ

  EQ --> SA
  EQ --> UAL
  EQ --> PN
  EQ --> SU

  EQ -->|"Failed after 3 retries"| DLQ
```

### Key Takeaways

| Aspect | How It Works on Railway |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Process model** | Single Node.js process runs API + Voice Worker + Events Worker |
| **Voice text** | Synchronous: Gemini call happens within the HTTP request (~2-5s) |
| **Voice audio** | Async: Job enqueued to Redis, worker processes, client polls for result |
| **Domain events** | Always async: Published to Redis BullMQ queue after DB write |
| **Event consumers** | 4 consumers run in the Events Worker: stats, activity log, push, streaks |
| **Failure handling** | Events retry 3x with exponential backoff, then move to Dead Letter Queue |
| **Scaling option** | Can split into API process + `node workers/event-consumer.js` as separate Railway service |
